# Challenge-0

🎫 Create a simple NFT to learn basics of 🏗 scaffold-eth. You'll use 👷‍♀️ HardHat to compile and deploy smart contracts. Then, you'll use a template React app full of important Ethereum components and hooks. Finally, you'll deploy an NFT to a public network to share with friends! 🚀

🌟 The final deliverable is an app that lets users purchase and transfer NFTs. Deploy your contracts to a testnet then build and upload your app to a public web server. Submit the url on SpeedRunEthereum.com!
